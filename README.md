# What is this
This is just a basic project to explore react development

## State management
I plan to add more examples regarding state management
1. Basic context (on master branch)
2. Store context with sliced reducer (To be added in the future)
3. Global context provider (HoC that registers provider into global provider)
4. Redux, etc
